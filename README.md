# Overview

**nanocap** is a protocol analyzer for the Nano network.

Raison d'Ãªtre:

* Validate that the protocol specification is correct
* The Nano protocol is evolving quickly and nanocap will be kept up to date as new relases of the protocol is made.
* Provide an alternative to Wireshark and bettercap with query capabilities helpfor for diagnosing issues on the Nano network.


# Build

nanocap uses the Conan package manager. See https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/installation.html for information on how to install Conan.

The easy way is `pip install conan`

Add the following Conan repositories for Boost and pcap++:

```
$ conan remote add bincrafters https://api.bintray.com/conan/bincrafters/public-conan
$ conan remote add andreybronin https://api.bintray.com/conan/andreybronin/conan
```

To download and build everything needed:

```
$ conan install . --build missing
```

To generate the build file:

```
$ cmake . -G <generator>
```

### Optional build flags

The nanocap repository contains pre-generated protocol parsers.

If `NANOCAP_GENERATE_PARSER` is set in CMake, C++ and Javascript parsers are automatically regenerated.

For this to work, kaitai-struct-compiler must be installed. In addition, the Kaitai protocol definition file must be located under `protocol/reference`. This is best done by adding the nanocurrency/protocol repository as a submodule.


# Configuration

See `nanocap.config` for configuration. In particular, the IP used for capturing should be set. `nanocap --if` gives you a list of network interfaces and the associated IP.

The `block_details` adds hashes and block details to the database. This increases pcap import times.

# Importing pcap files

Run `nanocap --pcap my.pcap`

Progress is available in the web console. Live capture can be started once the import is finished.

# Live capture

Run `nanocap`

# Web console

During import or live capture, progress can be watched at http://localhost:7077, which also provides a query interface.
